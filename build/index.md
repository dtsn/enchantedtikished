## Coming soon ...

I am busy rewriting a lot of code to make it easy for you to install and run in your own tiki shed. If you would like to help me, send me a message via the [contact page](/contact).

While this is happening here is a brief Q&A. Feel free to send me any messages via [twitter](https://twitter.com/tikished).

<ul class="q-a">
	<li>
		<div class="question">What do I need?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>
				The Enchanted Tiki Shed is an off the shelf solution it works using a range of smart lightbulbs from Phillips called Hue. These can be picked up everywhere including Amazon (wait for Black Friday/Prime Day and they are quite cheap).
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from a set of lightbulbs you will need a computer and speakers.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the moment the software is very hands on and requires a knowledge of JavaScript, we hope to remove this requirement and we progress the versions.
			</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="question">What will be open sourced?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>
				The NodeJS source code I use to time the music with the hue system. The source code for all the effects which I write and create. I cannot distribute the sound effects though since I am not the copyright holder for the majority of the music.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope to have some written using open source music soon.
			</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="question">How will I be able to create effects?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>
				You will need a system in order to edit sounds (Audicity is a good open source one, but we use Logic Pro to provide the surround sound effects).
			</p>
			<p>
				From that you will have to get down and dirty with some JavaScript. If you have any experience with coding it will be a breeze, if not it’s going to require some copy and pasting.
			</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<div class="question">When will it be released?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>
				The software isn’t quite ready for prime time. It’s still in early development and can be buggy, but I am looking for beta testers! Use the contact page to get in touch, you will need knowledge of NodeJS and a Github account.
