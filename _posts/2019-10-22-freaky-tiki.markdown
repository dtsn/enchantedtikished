## Headless Horseman
Ah, so you want to know the tale of the headless horseman? Well, it was a thundery October night, not unlike this very one here. 
What’s that (horse grunt)
Oh no, here’s here ...

### Cocktail
This is a very simple Strawberry Daiquiri it looks like mushed up brains. I toped this off with strawberry laces to add to the spewing out brain effect.

- Frozen Strawberries
- Z-up/Sprite
- 2 Shots of rum
