The opening cocktail of the 2019 Freaky Tiki Halloween overlay. This cocktail is the latest victim of the headless horseman. A legend of our old English lane (we live on a lane over a 100 years old) who slices the head of his victims. The cocktail is served in the cold (blue) head of his last victim. It features a garnish of dripping blood around the rim, and oozing brains (strawberry laces). Filled with a slushy strawberry daiquiri it's the perfect representation of Halloween.

## Instructions

### Ingredients (serves 2)
* Frozen Strawberries
* Lemon & Lime soda
* White rum

For the garnish:
* Sugar
* Water
* Red food colouring
* Strawberry laces

You first want to prepare the mugs with the dripping blood. Don't do this too much in advanced they tend to get sticky. Boil the sugar syrup (2 sugar to 1 water) add the red food colouring and heat up until it reaches hard crack stage (sugar thermometer should help). Drip the solution around the top of the mugs, be careful your mugs are not too cold - the difference in temperature could cause thermal-shock (practice on one first). Wait for the blood to cool.

Mix 1 cup of frozen strawberries with 1 can of lemon & lime soda (Sprite, Z-up etc). Add in two shots of white rum per person. Blitz it all together in a food processor - be really careful when opening. Pour the cocktail into the mug filled with ice. Apply a good helping of strawberry laces and serve.

## Effect

What’s that (horse grunt)
Oh no, here’s here ...
Hope you all have your head, this poor lass never made it
